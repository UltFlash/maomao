AVISPA Tool: README
===================

AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and
Applications) is a push-button tool for the automated validation of
Internet security-sensitive protocols and applications. It provides a
modular and expressive formal language for specifying protocols and
their security properties, and integrates different back-ends that
implement a variety of state-of-the-art automatic analysis techniques.

==============
1. DESCRIPTION
==============

AVISPA is a modular tool comprising a translator from HLPSL to IF and
a variety of state-of-the-art back-ends for protocol security analysis.
Currently the AVISPA tool consists of the following modules:

- hlpsl2if : translator from HLPSL to IF;
- cl-atse  : the Constraint-Logic-based Attack Searcher;
- ofmc     : the On-the-Fly Model-Checker;
- satmc    : the SAT-based Model-Checker; and
- ta4sp    : the Tree Automata tool based on Automatic Approximations 
             for the Analysis of Security Protocols.

Moreover, a helpful package is provided in order to aid the use of the
AVISPA Tool with XEmacs. 


==========
2. RUNNING
==========

You can execute AVISPA by issuing at the shell prompt:

  "avispa OPTION"
  "avispa MODULE MOPTION"
  "avispa FILE [OPTIONS] [MODULE MOPTIONS]"

where:

* OPTION:

  -h,  --help           : display this help and exit.
  -v,  --version        : output version information and exit.

* OPTIONS:

 --typed_model=TM       : IF specifications can be generated both in 
                          an untyped variant (set TM to 'no'), in a
                          typed variant (set TM to 'yes'), and in a
                          strongly-typed one (set TM to 'strongly').

                          (Default: 'yes')

 --output=DIR           : set the output directory to DIR. Namely the 
                          IF file, and any other file generated by the
                          selected back-end will be written in such a
                          directory.  Notice that DIR must be an
                          absolute path.

                          (Default: $AVISPA_PACKAGE/testsuite/results)

 --nowarnings           : do not display warnings in executing the 
                          hlpsl2if translator. 

 --no-hlpsl2if          : do not call the hlpsl2if tranlsator.  This
                          option is useful for passing IF files directly
                          to the tool.

* MODULE: selects a specific AVISPA sub-module. Accepted values are:

 --hlpsl2if : runs only the translator
 --cl-atse  : runs the translator (no particular option), then CL-AtSe
 --ofmc     : runs the translator (no particular option), then OFMC
 --satmc    : runs the translator (no particular option), then SATMC
 --ta4sp    : runs the translator (no particular option), then TA4SP

  (Default: hlpsl2if)

* MOPTION:

  --help    : display the module help and exit.
  --version : output module version information and exit.

* MOPTIONS: options given to the selected AVISPA module

  (Default: no particular option)
 
* FILE: the HLPSL file (or IF file when --no-hlpsl2if is used) to
  be analysed

Please see the INSTALL file for information about the setting of the
AVISPA_PACKAGE environment variable.

3. NOTES 
========

3.1 Supported settings.  

    Only the following combination of settings are currently
    supported:

    (1) When cl-atse is selected, then the analyses can be performed with
        respect to either the untyped or typed variant of an IF
        specification.
    
        --cl-atse
        --typed_model  = no | yes 

    (2) When ofmc is selected, then the analyses can be performed with
        respect to either the untyped or typed variant of an IF
        specification.
    
        --ofmc
        --typed_model  = no | yes
    
    (3) When satmc is selected, then the analyses can be performed with
        respect to either the typed or strongly-typed variant of an IF
        specification.
    
        --satmc
        --typed_model  = yes | strongly
    
    (4) When ta4sp is selected, then the analyses can be performed with
        respect to the typed variant of an IF specification.
    
        --ta4sp
        --typed_model  = yes 

3.2 Documentation of AVISPA sub-modules.

    Detailed explanation of the command options used by a specific
    AVISPA module goes beyond the scope of this section and the
    interested reader should consult the documentation provided with
    the module itself (e.g., the command options about satmc are
    explained in the README file inside the satmc directory
    $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/satmc_2.0/).

3.3 Backend configuration files.

    Some of the AVISPA backends (e.g., satmc and ta4sp) provide a
    configuration file (e.g., satmc.config and ta4sp.config) where the
    AVISPA user can change the default options for the backend. These
    files are stored in the directory $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/.

3.4 Contributions

    You may find several contributions in the AVISPA Tool package
    ($AVISPA_PACKAGE/contrib/) or directly on the AVISPA web site,
    such as the XEmacs mode. Please refer to the help files contained
    in the corresponding archives for usage and installation
    information.

5. PLATFORMS
======================

AVISPA is a modular tool and each of its modules has been tested under
the following different platforms, in each case on the x86
architecture and using the bash shell:

    * RedHat 8.0, Kernel Version 2.4.18-14
    * RedHat 9.0, Kernel Version 2.4.20-8
    * Suse 9.2, Kernel Version 2.6.8-24.11-default
    * FreeBSD 5.3, Kernel Version 5.3-RELEASE (GENERIC)
    * Debian 3.1, Kernel Version 2.6.8-1-386
    * Debian 3.1, Kernel Version 2.4.25-1-386

The AVISPA Tool should run on modern Linux and BSD systems.  We are
always happy to receive feedback about successes or failures to run
the AVISPA Tool on new or different platforms.
