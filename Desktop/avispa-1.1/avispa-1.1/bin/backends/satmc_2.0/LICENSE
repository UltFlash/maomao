SATMC is a modular tool that incorporates and makes use also of a
number of software packages not developed by the SATMC Team.

In particular SATMC may invoke one of the following SAT-solvers:

  - mchaff
  - zchaff
  - SIM
  - SATO v3.0

For the convenience of the user these solvers are distributed with
SATMC, but since they may rely on different licensing policies, users
of SATMC are invited to carefully read the licenses (if any)
associated with these solvers.

The rest of this LICENSE applies only to the software modules
developed by the SATMC Team.
