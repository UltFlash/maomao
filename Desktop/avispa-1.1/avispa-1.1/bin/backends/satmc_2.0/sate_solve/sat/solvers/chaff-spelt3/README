this is a hasity thrown together source distibution of chaff, version spelt3.

this is the current development version, and it has some strange features, and the code isn't as 
readable as it could be. but that said, the core of the solver should be fairly stable, and should 
(in combination with the chaff papers) allow anyone to build thier own solver or customize this one. 

be warned that i (matthew moskewicz) am not really planning on supporting this version. my plan is to
clean it up and simplify it in some ways, and then release the result of that effort as a "teaching"  
version that should be more accessible to the average programmer.

see also lintaoz zhang's zchaff, which is an implimenation based on an earlier version of chaff -- it
uses a simpler (but less general) method to maintain the DLs of implications on conflict classes (a
maximal unwind), which seems to work fine on average. this distribuation can be configured to behave
similarly, but doing so creates a lot of code that could be simplified.

having implimented this solver a bazzilion times has given me some insight into the most elegant 
formulations for the solver, and i beleive the entire solver core can be done in about 600 lines (in 
retrospect) so that's what i'll aim for in the next release.
