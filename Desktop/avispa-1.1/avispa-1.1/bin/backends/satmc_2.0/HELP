You can execute SATMC to issue at the shell prompt:

  "satmc OPTION"
  "satmc FILE [OPTIONS]" 

where:

* OPTION:
  -h,  --help       display this help and exit.
  -v,  --version    output version information and exit.

* OPTIONS:

  --solver=SOLVER		: SOLVER is the selected state-of-the-art 
				  SAT solver you want to use to
				  evaluate the satisfiability of the
				  generated propositional formula.
				  Accepted value are:
	                            'chaff'    : zChaff  solver selected;
	                            'mchaff'   : mChaff  solver selected;
		                    'sim'      : SIM solver selected; 
		                    'sato'     : SATO solver selected.
				  Default value of SOLVER is 'chaff';

  --max=MAX        		: MAX is the maximum depth of the 
				  search space up to which SATMC will
				  explore; it can be set to -1 meaning
				  infinite, but in this case the
				  procedure is not guaranteed to
				  terminate; by default it is set to
				  30;

  --enc=ENC	 		: ENC is the selected SAT reduction 
				  encoding technique; it can be set to
				  either:
				  - 'linear',
				  - 'gp-efa' (default value), or 
				  - 'gp-bca'; 
                                  'linear' and 'gp-bca' cannot be applied
	                          on IF v.2 specifications; 

  --mutex=MUTEX	 		: MUTEX is an integer indicating the 
                                  level of the mutex relations to be
                                  used during the SAT-reduction,
                                  namely:
				  0: mutex off (absRef on)
				  1: only static mutex (absRef off)
				  2: static and dynamic mutex (absRef
				     off); value accepted only when
				     the encoding is set to gp-bca
                                  Basically, if MUTEX is set to 0,
                                  then the abstraction/refinement
                                  strategy provided by SATMC is
                                  enabled; otherwise the
                                  abstraction/refinement strategy is
                                  disabled and the static mutexes are
                                  generated; moreover if --mutex=2 and
                                  --enc=gp-bca, then also the dynamic
                                  mutexes are generated; default value
                                  is 1;

  --ct=CT			: CT is a boolean parameter for 
				  enabling or disabling compound
				  types; by default it is set to true;

  --oi=OI			: OI is a boolean parameter for 
				  enabling or disabling the optimized
				  intruder model (i.e.the intruder is
				  able to extend immediately its
				  knowledge); by default it is set to
				  false;

  --sc=SC			: SC is a boolean parameter for 
				  enabling or disabling the
                                  step-compression optimization; by
                                  default it is set to true;
				  
  --check_only_executability=CE : CE is a boolean parameter for 
				  enabling or disabling the check on
				  executability of actions/rules
				  without any intruder. It is very
				  useful to debug the input
				  specification; by default it is set
				  to false;

  --output_dir=ODIR		: ODIR is the directory in which SATMC 
				  will store temporary files and put
				  the results of the analyses; (by
				  default and in the case the input
				  file is in the SATE language, these
				  files will be put in the same
				  directory in which FILE is
				  contained.)

  --if2sate=IF2SATE		: IF2SATE is the version of the 
				  compiler used for translating a IF
				  specification into a SATE
				  specification; it can be set either
				  to 1 or 2 (default value);
                                  the AVISPA tool uses IF v.2 
                                  specifications;  

  --prelude=PRELUDE		: PRELUDE is the prelude file 
				  (comprehensive of the path); by
				  default it is assumed that the
				  prelude file is in the same
				  directory of FILE with the name
				  'prelude.if';

  --avispa=AVISPA 		: AVISPA is a boolean parameter for 
				  enabling or disabling the AVISPA
				  output format; by default it is set
				  to true; for more details on the EU
				  project AVISPA see
				  http://www.avispa-project.org;

* FILE is either the IF or the SATE file (comprehensive of the path)
  you want to compile into SAT and analyze.
