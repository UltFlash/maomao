1. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
=========================

In order to execute SATMC v. 2.0 you need to extract files from the
archive satmc_2.0.tgz and then to set the environment variables:

SP_PATH, and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If the file 'satmc' is rooted in '/home/satmc_2.0/', then the above
environment variables should be set to:

'/home/satmc_2.0/lib/sicstus-3.12.3', and
'/home/satmc_2.0/lib'

respectively (please use absolute path). 

Now you should be able to execute SATMC v. 2.0.  Please see the README
file for informations about the command line options of SATMC.

============
3. PLATFORMS
============

The current distribution of SATMC has been tested, so far, with:

- bash shell, under PC Intel architecture, with different versions and
  distributions of Linux.  SATMC requires GLIB version 2.3 or greater
  to work properly.

- Mac OS X 10.4.5 Tiger.  If you are using SATMC on a different
  version of Mac OS X, please share your experience by sending a mail
  to us at satmc-support@ai.dist.unige.it.

SATMC is a modular open architecture that currently integrates four
different SAT solvers.  A detailed explanation of the platforms under
which these SAT solvers work goes beyond the scope of this section and
the interested reader should consult the documentation provided with
the SAT solver itself.  Some informations reported by SATMC' users
is given in the Troubleshooting section.

Should you encounter any difficulty in installing and running SATMC on
your machine, please send us a message to
satmc-support@ai.dist.unige.it

===================
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
===================

Follow some notes:

- the SAT solver mChaff requires libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 or greater.

- we do not include the SAT solver mChaff for the MAC OS X distribution.
