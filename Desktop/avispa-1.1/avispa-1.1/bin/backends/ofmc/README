==========================================================

Overview:
---------

The On-the-Fly Model-Checker OFMC is an analysis tool for security
protocols.  OFMC is based on the idea of the lazy intruder which is a
symbolic, constraint-based approach to modeling an intruder.  Combined
with the reduction technique known as constraint differentiation, the
lazy intruder allows OFMC to perform analyses very fast.

The most important new feature of this release is that the user can
specify an algebraic theory on message terms, modulo which the
analysis of the protocol is performed.  For more information on using
algebraic theories, see the file "user-guide-algebraic.pdf" in the
docs/ofmc directory included in this distribution.  Example theories
and IF specifications that employ algebraic theories can be found in
the directory testsuite/algebraic.

OFMC is developed in the context of the EU Project AVISPA (Automated
Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications,
www.avispa-project.org IST-2001-39252). Earlier development on OFMC
took place in the context of the predecessor project AVISS (Automated
Verification of Infinite-State Systems IST-2000-26410).

The AVISPA Tool also includes the protocol analysis tools SATMC,
developed by the group of Alessandro Armando at the university of
Genova; CL-AtSe, developed by the group of Michael Rusinowitch at the
INRIA institute in Nancy; and TA4SP, developed at INRIA, Besancon.

All analysis tools of the AVISPA project are based on two
specification languages: HLPSL (the High-Level Protocol Specification
Language) and IF (the Intermediate Format). The HLPSL allows for an
easy description of protocols by the user, while the IF is a low-level
language suited for automatic input to analysis tools.  The HLPSL2IF
translator, also shipped as part of the AVISPA Tool, is developed at
INRIA Nancy.


Usage:
------

In general, OFMC is called directly by the AVISPA Tool.  You can
specify OFMC as the desired back-end using the --ofmc switch as
follows:
   avispa <filename> [OPTIONS] --ofmc [OFMC OPTIONS]

Note that, at the present time, support for algebraic theories is
limited to protocols specified directly in IF.  If you want to use IF
files directly avispa, then the "--no-hlpsl2if" option can be given to
indicate that the AVISPA Tool does not need to call the translator.

Should you wish to call OFMC directly, you can do so as follows:

   ofmc <filename> [-theory <TheoryFile> ] [-sessco] [-untyped] 
                   [-d <DEPTH>] [-p <PATH>]

Meaning of the arguments:

- <filename> is an IF file to be checked.  IF files are generated
   by the AVISPA Tool or by hlpsl2if directly.

- -theory allows the user to specify a custom algebraic theory given
   in the file <TheoryFile>.  See the file "user-guide-algebraic.pdf"
   in the docs/ofmc directory for more information, including details
   about the default algebraic theory used by OFMC.  See also the
   examples in directory testsuite/examples.

- -sessco performs an executability check on the protocol
   specification and then performs an analysis using session
   compilation, an optimization for the quick detection of replay
   attacks.

- -untyped specifies that the analysis should be performed in an
   untyped model.  Typing information in the IF specification will
   be ignored.

- -d allows you to specify that the analysis should proceed only
   up to maximum search depth <DEPTH> in the search tree.

- Using the -p option, one can browse the search tree "manually",
   where <PATH> is a white-space separated list of integers specifying
   a path in the search tree.  For example:
   -p   is the root node
   -p 0 is the first (left-most) successor of root node
   -p 0 1 is the second successor (next to left-most) successor
          of the node obtained by -p 0
   If you specify the path to a non-existing node, an exception is raised.

All of these options can also be passed to OFMC via the AVISPA Tool as
[OFMC OPTIONS] as shown above.
