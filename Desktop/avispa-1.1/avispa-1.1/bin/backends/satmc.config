# SATMC: configuration file

# This is the SATMC configuration file.  See the 
#
#   $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/satmc_2.0/README
#
# file for more information.  This file provides options defaults
# values.  The values can be changed by modifying the appropriate
# lines.

# The prelude option set the name of the prelude file comprehensive of
# the path.  Such a path can be either an absolute path or a relative
# path with respect to $AVISPA_PACKAGE (the AVISPA package root
# directory).  The special characters '~/' and '../' as well as
# environment variables are not allowed.
prelude=testsuite/prelude.if
# prelude=/tmp/prelude.if

# The max option set the maximum depth of the search space up to which
# SATMC will explore; it can be set to -1 meaning infinite, but in
# this case the procedure is not guaranteed to terminate
max=30
# max=-1

# The option solver selects the state-of-the-art SAT solver you want
# to use to evaluate the satisfiability of the generated propositional
# formulae. Accepted value are:
#   'chaff'    : zChaff solver selected;
#   'mchaff'   : mChaff solver selected;
#   'sim'      : SIM solver selected; 
#   'sato'     : SATO solver selected.
# By default it is set to 'chaff'.
solver=chaff
# solver=sim

# The option mutex is an integer indicating the level of the mutex
# relations to be used during the SAT-reduction, namely:
# 0: mutex off (absRef on)
# 1: only static mutex (absRef off)
# 2: static and dynamic mutex (absRef off); value accepted only when
#    encoding set to gp-bca
# Basically, if mutex is set to 0, then the abstraction/refinement
# strategy provided by SATMC is enabled; otherwise the
# abstraction/refinement strategy is disabled and the static mutexes
# are generated; moreover if mutex=2 and the gp-bca encoding has been
# selected, then also the dynamic mutexes are generated. Default value
# is 1.
mutex=1
# mutex=0

# The option oi is a boolean parameter for enabling or disabling the
# optimized intruder model (i.e. the intruder is able to extend
# immediately its knowledge); by default it is set to false.
oi=false
# oi=true

# The option sc is a boolean parameter for enabling or disabling
# the step compression optimization.
sc=true
# sc=false

# The check_only_executability option is a boolean parameter for
# enabling or disabling the check on executability of actions/rules
# without any intruder.  It is very useful to debug the input
# specification, but it disables the real analyses of the protocol
# (i.e. when enabled only the executability test is performed); by
# default it is set to false.
check_only_executability=false
# check_only_executability=true

# The avispa option is a boolean parameter for enabling or disabling
# the AVISPA output format; if disabled the output will be more
# verbose and in a AI planning style showing what SATMC does phase by
# phase; by default the AVISPA output format is enabled.
avispa=true
# avispa=false
