# level=i
# if i = 0 then an over-approximation is computed.
# if i > 0 then an under-approximation is computed.
# Usually, over-approximations are used to prove that 
# a property is safe for the given initial state.
# Under-approximations are used to show that there is an 
# attack. However, this attack may be due to some abstractions 
# done and thus the user has to interpret this result.
level=0



# Usually, the abstraction make the computation faster.
# However, it may provide some false attack if abstractions 
# are too coarse. But, good results have been obtained with such 
# abstractions. These abstractions correspond to the option 
# '--2AgentsOnly' explained in the 
#
#   $AVISPA_PACKAGE/bin/backends/TA4SP/README
#
# file.
