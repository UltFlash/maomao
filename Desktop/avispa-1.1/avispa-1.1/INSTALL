1. DESCRIPTION
==============

AVISPA is a modular tool comprising a translator from HLPSL to IF and
a variety of state-of-the-art back-ends for protocol security analysis.
Currently the AVISPA tool consists of the following modules:

- hlpsl2if : translator from HLPSL to IF;
- cl-atse  : the Constraint-Logic-based Attack Searcher; and
- ofmc     : the On-the-Fly Model-Checker;
- satmc    : the SAT-based Model-Checker;
- ta4sp    : the Tree Automata tool based on Automatic Approximations 
             for the Analysis of Security Protocols.

Moreover, some additional packages are provided in order to aid the
use of the AVISPA Tool:
- an edition mode for XEmacs;
- the AVISPA Library of Protocols, specified in HLPSL;
- scripts for transforming HLPSL specifications into documentation
  (LaTeX or HTML);
- a translator of attack traces to messages sequence charts.

Note that a separate package provides the AVISPA tool with a graphical
interface (written in PHP).


=========================
2. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
=========================

AVISPA is distributed already compiled. To install the binary
distribution of AVISPA follow the instructions below:

1. Download the most recent versions of AVISPA from the addresses
   listed above into a convenient directory, (e.g., /tmp).

2. Move to the root directory where you want to install AVISPA. Let's
   say "/opt" and untar the distribution:

        % cd /opt
	% tar -xzf /tmp/avispa-package-X.Y_Linux-i686.tgz

   This command will create a directory "/opt/avispa-X.Y" containing
   the AVISPA files (X.Y is the release number).

3. Set the AVISPA_PACKAGE environment variable:

	% export AVISPA_PACKAGE=/opt/avispa-X.Y

4. Add the directory /opt/avispa-X.Y to your command search PATH
   environment variable:

	% export PATH=$PATH:$AVISPA_PACKAGE

Now you are ready to run and enjoy AVISPA.  Please see the README file
for information about the command line options of AVISPA. 


The AVISPA package provides several contributed packages, such as a
user-friendly mode for XEmacs to allow a simple interaction between
the user and the modules of the AVISPA package.  To set-up those
additonal packages follow the instructions below:

5. Move to the "$AVISPA_PACKAGE/contrib" directory and uncompress the
   corresponding archive file.  For example:

        % cd $AVISPA_PACKAGE/contrib
	% tar -xzf avispa-mode.tgz

   This command will create a new directory containing more precise
   installation instructions.

6. Follow those instructions for completing the installation.
